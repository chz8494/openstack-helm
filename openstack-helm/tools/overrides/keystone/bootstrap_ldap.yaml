# NOTE(lamt): This configuration is used to demonstrate how you would bootstrap
# a domain (named "default") that is backed by LDAP.  This can be used for
# demo and testing purposes, but care should be taken if additional domain is
# added to keystone. There can only be 1 domain that is SQL-backed in this
# scenario, as keystone currently cannot support multiple SQL-backed domains if
# the original bootstrapped domain is LDAP-based.
